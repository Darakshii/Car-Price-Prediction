# Car-Price-Prediction
1. **Problem Statement**:
   - Developed a predictive model to help Geely Auto understand the factors influencing car prices in the US market.
   - Conducted extensive data analysis to identify significant variables affecting car prices.

2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Collected a large dataset of cars across the American market.
   - Preprocessed the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features such as 'fueleconomy' and 'carsrange.'

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Utilized various EDA techniques including histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps to gain insights into the dataset.
   - Discovered key patterns and relationships between variables, providing valuable insights for model building.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Engineered features by creating dummy variables for categorical features and scaling numerical features using MinMaxScaler.
   - Employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select relevant features for model building.

5. **Model Building and Selection**:
   - Built multiple linear regression models using RFE-selected features to predict car prices.
   - Refinement of models involved dropping insignificant variables based on statistical analysis (e.g., p-values, VIF).

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as R-squared value, F-statistic, and residual analysis.
   - Ensured model robustness and validity through rigorous testing on the test dataset.

7. **Business Impact**:
   - Derived actionable insights from the model, aiding Geely Auto in strategic decision-making and pricing strategies in the US market.
   - Demonstrated the ability to translate data-driven findings into actionable business recommendations.

8. **Skills and Tools**:
   - Utilized Python programming language along with libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
   - Leveraged data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing insights from the data.
   - Applied statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and feature engineering methodologies to solve complex business problems.
